    "The project's goal is to create an analysis using information on movies, including production budgets, sales and the percentage of viewers that like each film, gathered from many websites. This analysis's outcome will make it easier to select the greatest film to produce financially for the future Microsoft Studios."

    "Microsoft Studios wants to produce original video content, but they have no idea how to go about doing so. The goal of this analysis is to explore what types of films are doing the best and will most likely generate revenue post production.\n",
    "This will be done in the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Defining key factors to evaluate a film's profitability using production budget, ratings or gross revenue.\n",
    "    2. Examining profitability of different movie attributes like release date, genre, director, length of the movie and  popularity.\n",
    "    3. Coming up with a step by step guide of choosing the best movie financially using the 5 W's to gether with the attributes mentioned above."
